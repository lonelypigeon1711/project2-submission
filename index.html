        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> The goal of this assignment was to take a website and understand its issues and underlying problems.
             From there, wireframes, visual designs, and prototypes were created to aid in creating a redesign of the website. 
            This redesign would address the observed issues and be responsive to the user. </p>

        <h2>Webpage</h2>
        <p> The website I have chosen is for a preschool in Los Angeles called New World Montessori School. 
            The site appears to be quite dated, and it doesn't look like its been updated since at least 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below, I note the problems and the accessibility concerns:
        </p>
        <div id="sum">
            <p id="one"> - Font not legible without zooming in. <br>
                - Clashing colors make the site loose a sense of cohesion. <br>
                - Text covers most of the screen, making the site overwhelming and cluttered. <br>
                - Menu feels hidden in header.<br>
                - Lack of search bar limits user's ability to navigate site.<br>
                - Images have dated effects, and unclean cutouts.  

            </p>
            <p id="two">
                - Images don't have alt text. <br>
                - Low contrast makes it difficult to differentiate certain text and sections. Especially on the "CULTURALLY DIVERSIFIED" heading. <br>
                - Unordered lists. <br><br>

                After seeing the accesibility report, these concerns are valid.
                 To an average person, the issues brought up might not affect the user's experience with the site.
                  But in order to make the site accessible for all, these concerns are ones that will definitely be addressed in the redesign.

        <p>Below are the low-fidelity wireframes that illustrate the basic design that would address many of the concerns of the real site. </p>

        <h2>Redesign</h2>
        <p>The link below takes you to the redesigned site for New World Montessori School. 
            Navigational elements appear to show the layout, but don't actually redirect to another page. 
            Thus the site will not be interactive, but instead serves to show how the site could be improved.
            The site should be responsive in the way that it changes based on the size of the screen.
